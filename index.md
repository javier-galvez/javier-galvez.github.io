### About me 

<img src="images/me" alt="me_image">

My name is Javier Gálvez. I was born in Culiacán, México where I studied at the [Technological Institute of Culiacán](https://itculiacan.edu.mx/) to obtain my Bachelor degree on Mechatronic Engineering in 2013. During my career I was involved in several scholar projects mainly related to the design and control of mobile robots and robots arms. Further, I had the oportunities to do two summer research stays. The first one was on the [Research Center of Automotive Mechatronics](http://cima.tol.itesm.mx/) at the Monterrey Institute of Technology where I designed a virtual city with different road conditions in order to help to validate the mathematical model of a control system for an electric vehicle with embedded motor wheels. The second one, was on the the [Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí](http://www.uaslp.mx/) where I worked in the development of PID controller for a robot arm.

After that, I taked a job where I learned a lot of stuff about automation in industries, mainly in the fishmeal production. But my curiosity about the computer vision field lead me to study a Master degree. So, I went to México City to the [National Polytechnic Institute](http://www.ipn.mx) at the [Center of Innovation and Computer Technology Development](http://www.cidetec.ipn.mx). By sugestion of my advisors Prof. Magdalena Marciano and Prof. Hind Taud, I took a project that, in short, consisted in the development of a computer vision algorithm to detect mitotic cells of breast cancer in histopathologies images. With my thesis, we participied in [Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016](http://tupac.tue-image.nl/node/62). Without expected, during my Master studies, I find out a new and excited field: "machine learning". Since then I dedicate most of my time understanding and learning about it. During my graduate studies I had the lucky to attend to a conference of one of the greatest scientist in this field: [Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/). He recived doctor honoris causa from the Instituto Polytécnico Nacional. Antoher distinguished and amazing scientist of this field who recive this degree was: [Sebastian Thrun](http://robots.stanford.edu/personal.html). I'm feel very fortunate.

Few weeks later after that ceremony, [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), the online university founded by Sebastian Thrun, anounce a new program: Self-Driving Car nanodegree. This course involve a merge of some fields: computer vision, robotics, sensor fusion, control and machine learning. That's ingredients are perfect to delight my curiosity. Is the oportunity to use most of the things I have learned in my life and go futher to learn about things that I'm interested. Without dude it, I enrolled in this program. And is what I'm doing now.

### Interest

I feel very fortunate and excited to live at this time of the humanity, where the possibilities to make big and positives changes in society are plausible with all of this technology.

About all the profesionist I have know, among the most admirable people are scientist. I want to be, in some way, like them. I can mention a lot of positive points to be a scientist but it's worth to mention that I want to take part of the people that shape the future, a shape that benefit the humanity.

I hope one day be a researcher in Robotics and Machine Learning. I believe I have the tools to go in the right way to achieve it. In the case that I'm wrong, I sure that I can learn it.
